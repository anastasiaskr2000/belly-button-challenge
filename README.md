In this assignment, I will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

**The following images display the dashboard with some samples of the test subjects and corresponding visualizayions showcasing genetic biodiversity. Run the app.js & index.html to launch the interactive dashboard in your browser & play around with the dropdown to explore further.**
